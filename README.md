This was built using Java Spring Boot and provides the core API for managing users, events, and authentication using JWT tokens. It integrates with a database to handle data persistence for users and event details. 

:rocket:Key features include:

- [x] *User Authentication:* Handles user registration, login, and role-based access using JWT for secure session management.

- [x] *Event Management:* Provides APIs to create, update, and delete events, including fields like event name, description, date, and time slots (morning, afternoon, evening, night).

- [x] *Role-based Access:* Admin and organizer-specific APIs, with restricted access based on user roles (admin, organizer, and regular users).

- [x] *RESTful API:* Follows REST principles to offer scalable and maintainable endpoints for the frontend to interact with.
